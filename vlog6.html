            <h3>travel information</h3>
            <p>
                Ramessaram is famous with it's bridge its called Pampan Bridge. Pamban Bridge is a railway bridge which connects the town of Mandapam in mainland India with Pamban Island, and Rameswaram.
                Opened on 24 February 1914 .it was India's first sea bridge, and was the longest sea bridge in India until the opening of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in 2010.the time i traveld there in 2013's 
                We started early, at around 6.30 am from Calicut to Rameshwaram. We reached around 4 pm, with 2-3 breaks including a 45 min lunch break in a very nice place , sort of a small temple. We had a short stop in Pamban Bridge , which actually connects the main land with the Rameshwaram island. This bridge is known for the railway line that goes much below the main bridge for other vehicles and how the bridge.
                We had booked rooms for us in the Sringeri Mutt’s branch that is available next to the Temple entrance near the Agni Theertham side. We went and had some refreshments.
                First stop was the Agni Theertham, which is nothing but the sea shore. Everyone had prepped me saying that the sea will be too calm and that it will be a small dip and all that. But when we went there, it had huge waves and the weather was a little rough with heavy winds ….What can I say… It was just a day after Full Moon.at that time 
                i was much surprised by walkig along with my friends across the sea side , actually we were walking almost 12 kilomiters and finaly we were reached our destination the name of that destination is Danushkodi.
                Dhanushkodi is a place about 17 km’s away. It is supposed to be the eastern edge of the Rameshwaram island and is only a few miles away from Sri Lanka. It was a city till 1964, which was destroyed in the cyclone that year. i could see the ruins of the city. This is a place which has a legend associated with Ramayana. i may find this place very interesting depending on what interests to, but i could surely enjoy the unique journey to this place. Only a four-wheel drive can take me there. There are groups that take me there in what can be called a small truck, with two benches on opposite sides and a rope to climb and get down.
                 in earlier there was a bridge. But now it is not possible to travel along the road.After that i visted Rameswaram temple on there that is historical monemels made before 500 years with traditional way 
                but inside of this temple still look litile bit modern.When i get back to the home the memories of those places were unforgatable.
