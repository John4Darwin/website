            <h3>travel information</h3>
            <p>
                Hydrabad is the largest city of the south india.which shaped its history. The city is noted for its monuments which includes the masterpiece of Charminar and the fort of Golconda. There are a multitude of masjids, temples, churches and bazaars in the city.
                Now it is famous with tourist attractions. when i was late 17's i have traveld there and enjoyd lot my on way. Charminar is the great when see on far from the city as well as inside of this.
                Charminar was given to a contractor called Sanamvenkata Balaya to construct and today one can see the city as evidence of the prayer being answered. The Mosque was called as Charminar because of its four minarets.
                The structure was constructed from granite, lime, mortar and, some say, pulverised marble. Initially the monument with its four arches was planned in such a way that when the fort was opened one could catch a glimpse of the bustling Hyderabad city as these 
                Charminar arches were facing the streets. There is also a legend of an underground tunnel connecting the palace at Golkonda to Charminar, with the intention of being an escape route for the Qutub Shahi rulers in case of a siege, though the exact location of the tunnel is not known.
                The bazaars surrounding the Charminar are also bustling. Herein, one can find a wide variety of products, ranging from bangles to books and from CDs to pearls. “Pearls” are the actual specialty of the
                and also beautiful churches, temples and masjids.
                Hyderabad is a city of pearls, biryani, kebabs and monuments. The only precaution one needs to keep in mind, however, is that anything related to communalism and the political situation in the middle-east should never be discussed in public. Issues related to the Telangana region should be avoided in discussions.
                 Once, these precautions are taken, Hyderabad is a paradise to be in; a place harbouring everything a human being needs.
                Moreover i have seen a film name was Avatar from there the reason why i say that it was South Asia's biggest theater addition to say that 
                the one thig that i have much surprised is non other than Ramuji film city.by the time i came inside of Ramuji ,that was an amazing ,i felt like another world.  Basically it is the place to shot the film ,all the things are there a directer actually want to shot the film
                The time i was arrived so lucky because at that time the film has been shoting that was so surprised.this travel was an memorable moments for me.
