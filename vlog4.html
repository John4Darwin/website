            <h3>travel information</h3>
            <p>
                Munnar is the great place to travel along with family.The main speciality of this places is it has got 
                hill point,coffea plants on the hill. they give fresh air as well as fresh mind to explore more  wild 
                experience.the first time that i was in munnar. The climate was nice on there and also could saw snow falling
                that was amzing experience for me.
                It was a 5 day trip. So, our journey to Munnar began. We went through Udumalpet, then, Marayoor, and then Munnar. after reaching Munnar, we decided not to go to the places we have already gone during the Flower show. So, we checked out all the places to see in Munnar. 
                 Our driver gave a lot of information.
                 First we decided to go to Tea Museum, which is a part of Tata Tea. It portrayed the growth of the tea estates and the role of technology in it. I went through each detail in the tea processing. I loved the recession part of it where they allow tasting tea of various flavours.
                 Then, we headed towards Eravikulam National Park. Once, we reached the entrance we had to wait in a queue to buy a ticket and also for getting into the forest bus. It was a mini bus which came to pick us up. At least there were 15 other people were present with us in the bus. Our bus moved into the park. I was excited to see what comes up. Once, we reached the main area, the bus dropped us and went back. We were following our guide, who was giving information
                 The next day planned to move towards Pothamedu viewpoint. It just was 16 minutes away from our hotel. It is the perfect place because it is a view point from you can see all tea estates and mountains. My experience with Pothamedu was amazing.
                In oder to develop the tourisum on there the bus transportation utilizes on effective way.
                and who would interested in trucking also encarages to do for that on the way by jeep. However we were in bus we could't enjoy more rather than
                jeep travelers, But we were still enjoying in our on way.
